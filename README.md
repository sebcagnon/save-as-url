# Using a modified URL shortener to save encoded text as url

I have an application for which I need a simple way to save projects as a short string.

The application projects can be exported as XML, which I encode to base 64 and send to this service.

The service returns a short url that I can write down and reuse later to retrieve the project.

# Original project

This project is actually a fork of the following tutorial:

> This code is for the tutorial on creating a URL shortener using NodeJs, Express, and MongoDB.

> Check out the full tutorial at [coligo](http://coligo.io/create-url-shortener-with-node-express-mongo/)

I decided to create a different project for it simply because the goal is changed from the original url shortener.
